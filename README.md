## How to get the most out of this workshop

Just a reminder that we won't be learning how to write unit tests. So to get the most out of this workshop, you should be familiar with the basics of writing unit tests. If you aren't familiar with that, here's some resources to check out:

Short 24 minute intro to unit testing JavaScript: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2eWfvcAOTI

My pluralsight course on Unit Testing Angular: https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/unit-testing-angular/table-of-contents

Note that you don't need to understand Angular particularly well to get the most out of this workshop.
